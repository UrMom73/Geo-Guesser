# Geo-Guesser
Just a fun game you can play in the console :)
Written in JS

Instructions for how to play:
1. There are 10 rounds in this game. Each round will describe some place and it is your job to figure out where that place is located. Try your best not to cheat!
2. Each round will ask you to call a function because I'm not very good at coding. You will have to put the city name followed by the country in the form of string as 2 arguments. Make sure all characters are lowercase, like so: fakeFunction('shanghai','china');  MAKE SENSE?!@#
3. I think that's it. To start, call the following function with no arguments: geoGuesser(); Have fun!
