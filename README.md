# Geo-Guesser
Just a fun game you can play in the console :)
Written in JS

Instructions for how to play:
1. There are 10 rounds in this game. Each round will describe some place and it is your job to figure out where that place is located. Try your best not to cheat!
2. To guess on each round, call the following function: geoGuesser(); In the parentheses, put in 2 string arguments, the city followed by the country. Make sure all characters are lowercase. Like this: geoGuesser('madrid','spain');
3. I think that's it. To start, call the function geoGuesser(); with no parameters. Have fun!
